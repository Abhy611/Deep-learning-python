With gliomas making up 78% of malignant brain tumors, gliomas are the most common type of adult brain tumor.The four grades of gliomas range from Grade I, which is the least aggressive, to Grade IV, which is the most aggressive. 
The two most aggressive glioma forms are anaplastic astrocytoma (Grade III) and glioblastoma multiforme (Grade IV).In the field of medical imaging, glioma-type classification is a significant problem. This is because on 
medical images like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the two grades of glioma, grade III and grade IV, can be challenging to identify from one another. Deep learning (DL) techniques have lately gained popularity for creating 
automated systems that can quickly and reliably categorize or diagnose brain tumors [3]. Complex patterns in medical photos that are challenging for human professionals to see can be recognised by DL-based algorithms. In terms of 
diagnosis and preoperative planning, the outcomes of classification and segmentation employing DL techniques have been highly successful. For instance, it has been demonstrated that DL-based algorithms can accurately 
classify brain tumors as benign or malignant with accuracies of above 90%. To create DL-based systems that can accurately categorize glioma types, there are still several issues that need to be resolved. One issue is the dearth of 
sizable databases of expert-labeled glioma images that are publically accessible. Glioma tumors can have a wide range of appearances based on their locations, sizes, and grades, which presents another difficulty.
